    <center><box3> These are my animals. The black one is Marceline the Vampire Queen and she is a Black Lab and German Shepherd mix. She is 1 and a half years old and is super loving and really high energy. She loves her little bro Fozzie Bear. He is a Great Pyrenees and German Shepherd mix and is 5 months old. He is the leader of the pack. He loves to lie around and make noises while he sleeps. I love them both very much and will miss them while I'm attending DevMountain. </box3><box4><img src="./images/mydogs.jpg" alt="Dogs" style="width:50%"></box4></center>
